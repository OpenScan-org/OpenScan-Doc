# OpenScan - 3D Scanner

## Summary

OpenScan is a modular concept, which can be used to build your photogrammetry based 3D scanner. You can simply use the individual modules and adjust it to your needs
(i.e. firmware, 3d printed design, PCB, photogrammetry cloud processing ...). The center piece is a Raspberry Pi driven camera/motor controller, which can be used to drive various photogrammetry rigs.

The project is based on the contribution of many great and open-minded people by doing tutorials on YouTube, comments on Reddit, publications on GitHub and many other places. Without all those voluntary contributors, this project would not be possible at all.

## Bugs & Feature requests

If you like the project and want to help to make it even better, please consider supporting in any of the following ways:

- **report a bug** or create a **feature request** - this can be a minor typo in the firmware, a missing piece in the documentation or a major design revision. Don't be afraid, if you have no programming background: [This guide](guideline/report_bug/) contains all the information you need.
- **share the project** and scanning results with the world - the more people join, the faster the project will improve
- improve the **design or electronics**
- help with the **documentation**
- create **video tutorials** or any other **educational resources**
