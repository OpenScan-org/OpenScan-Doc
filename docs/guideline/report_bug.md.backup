# How to create an issue on GitHub

Did you find an annoying bug or have a great idea on how to improve OpenScan. No matter if it is just a misaligned text in the firmware or a revolutionary new scanner design that you want to share.

If you are new to Github 


If you have no prior experience with GitHub, follow closely in order to make it easier to fix issues and implement new features.

## How to submit an issue

For the following steps a free GitHub account is needed:

#### Navigate to the right repository

- Choose the right topic and open it in a new tab:

  - Electronics
  - CAD
  - Firmware
  - Cloud
  - Documentation
  - other

- Navigate to Issues (1)
- Use the search/filter to check if there is already a solution to the problem (e.g. "cloud") (2)
- Please take some time to read the existing issues/solutions carefully
- If needed, continue to create a new issue (3)

#### Create a new issue

**TODO ADD SCREENSHOT**

- Choose one of the existing templates (e.g. bug report, feature request, design idea ...)
- Use the given structure as much as possible (but feel free to deviate from it as needed). 
- You can add photos/screenshots and even videos. Try to be as specific as possible.
- Feel free to add labels.
- Submit the issue
- Note, that it does not help, if the issue is published on other plattforms, as all development is coordinated here on Github.
- You will be notified by mail as soon as the status of the issue changes (e.g. someone needs more details)
- Inactive issues will be closed after 30 days

A final, but very important note: (Unfortunately) there is no payed developer team behind this project (yet ;) and it is maintained by a group of enthusiasts in their free time. So please bare this in mind, when submitting any kind of issue.
