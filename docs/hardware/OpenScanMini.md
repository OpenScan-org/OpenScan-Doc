![OS_mini](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174252972-7d1f8ca2-e316-400d-b8b6-607e3f5f5140.jpg)

## Overview

The OpenScan Mini is a compact desktop 3D scanner capable of scanning objects up to ~8-10 cm with an accuracy of up to 0.02 mm. The frame can be fully 3d printed, and all other components are off-the-shelf parts. You should be able to source all parts locally, or chose to support the OpenScan project by ordering (some) parts through [OpenScan.eu/shop](https://www.openscan.eu/shop). Currently, the following cameras can be used without any additional modifications: Arducam IMX519 16MP & autofocus, Pi Camera v2 8MP and Pi Camera v1.3 5MP, where the Arducam IMX519 has to be considered the gold standard (for now :)

## 3D Printing

Get the printable .stl (and design) files [here](https://github.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan-Design/tree/main/OpenScanMini).

**PRINTER**

- you will need a print bed of at least 200x200mm
- depending on your printer's capabilities (and your risk aversion), all parts can be fitted onto one build plate of min. 220x210mm
- printing all parts can be done in under 17h (tested on Prusa MK3S+ using default Draft profile)

**PRINT SETTINGS**

- support: only for 07_polarizer_b
- layer-height: 0.2-0.3 mm
- print speed: depends on your printer's calibration

**MATERIAL**

- COLOR - main Frame: Please use a material without visible particles or structure. Avoid transparent materials
- COLOR - 07_polarizer_a: translucent/natural
- COLOR - 07_polarizer_b: any non-translucent material (like PETG black, Prusament Galaxy Black)
- PLA is totally fine, since there is not a lot of mechanical strength needed
- PETG, ABS, ASA can be used for increased temperature resistance in warm environments

### Preparing the camera cable

* 1x camera ribbon cable (50cm)

Insert the camera ribbon cable through the two slots (red arrows). Make sure that the metal plating of the cable is facing the stepper motor (yellow circle).
**Take care not to create sharp bends as this might damage the cable.**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174072692-455368ca-7a0b-497c-8972-670d874e2e8e.png)

Continue through the next slot (again the metal plating should be facing away from you):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174072990-5dd92e10-4e8b-439f-b5c1-4b65b0573030.png)

Insert the camera ribbon cable into the socket. The metal plating should be facing away from the USB/Ethernet ports (yellow circle). Gently push down on the socket clamp to close it (dark part that likes to break).

Guide the ringlight cable as indicated by the yellow circles:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174090027-2d1beaf6-c534-471c-bbe4-a1a458adef7a.png)

#### Ringlight Variant: Arducam IMX519 16mp with the slide-in mount
* 1× Ringlight PCB
* 1× Arducam IMX519 16MP camera module
* OpenScan slide-in mount
* lid for the OpenScan slide-in mount
* 4× M3×12 screws

Start by sliding the camera module into the mount as pictured below until it snaps in place. **Take care that the small black camera cable slides cleanly into the recess (left side in the image).**

![01insert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218055061-ce4bbe95-fad9-4d83-b638-9f8e1b1e828e.jpg)
![02slide](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218055945-b0ad8791-660c-4991-a50c-367d68f87adb.jpg)

Flip the mount and check that the lens sits as pictured:
![03check](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218056417-6cee16e4-5469-4bf5-8693-55f925c419dd.jpg)

Place two of the M3×12 screws as pictured:
![04place-screws](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218056474-aa86811f-3cd9-401f-9c4b-9bda1f7894be.jpg)

Slide the ringlight module onto the screws and press it into its recess in the mount:
![05place-ringlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218089255-274204e4-2366-4914-86b8-897390c78af4.jpg)


**Check that the lens is centered so it doesn't touch the edge of the ringlight PCB. Otherwise it might get damaged during focussing!** If necessary adjust its position in the rails.

Insert the camera ribbon cable through the aperture in the mount:
![07place-mount](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218057916-94762255-4db1-463e-858e-12f32759b8ac.jpg)

Place the remaining two M3×12 screws and tighten them until the mount sits snugly on the rotor arm:
![08tighten-screws](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218058112-4bc832c4-ead1-4787-a136-8da577ed9096.jpg)

Look on the sides and check that there is no gap and the PCB is not visible anymore:
![09check-tightness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218058489-a66b0fe2-8580-487a-8ca6-c6901bc49cd9.jpg)


Pull some length of cable upwards to give yourself some slack. Connect the cable to the camera module as pictured. The metal contacts need to face towards the camera's PCB:
![10connect-cable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218058513-75b959da-f2e7-40d3-af35-e84944c5d235.jpg)

Pull the cable down again, so as little length of cable as possible remains inside, but make sure the cable is not under tension. Place the lid onto the mount and push it in:
![11close-lid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218058849-46ec453b-368b-41af-8369-e1afd7a21eec.jpg)

Don't forget to connect the pink ringlight cable:
![12connect-ringlight-cable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20565623/218060092-e03d6a9c-150b-47f5-944f-3ffd0b9cb8b2.jpg)


Guide the ringlight cable as indicated by the yellow circles:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174090027-2d1beaf6-c534-471c-bbe4-a1a458adef7a.png)

### Connecting the Pi Shield
* 1x Frontplate with Pi Shield
* 2x stepper motor cable

Connect the stepper motor cables to the Pi Shield and the corresponding stepper motors (see labels bellow):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174090377-aad5fdb1-fe46-4c98-8993-eb941254509e.png)

* (1) Turntable (small Nema 17)
* (2) Rotor (large Nema 17)
* (3) ST XH 3P (from ringlight module, see previous step)

### Mounting the Frontplate
* 1x M3x12 screw
* 1x frontplate with Pi Shield
* 1x base/rotor

Mount the frontplate to the base. **Make sure that the pin headers of the Raspberry Pi and the Pi shield are properly aligned (yellow circle):**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174091581-3bbc2ec2-97e7-4629-83f1-7ec37a521db4.png)

Use the M3 screw to connect the frontplate to the base:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174091474-c69e5b4e-965c-44b3-a53d-5347741ceaaa.png)

### Mounting the Backplate
* 4x M3x8 screws
* base/rotor
* backplate (3d print)

Make sure the ringlight cable is sitting in the guide slot (yellow circle).
Use the 4 M3x8 screws to mount the backplate (red arrows):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174092053-64635fb3-bd46-4a16-9aa4-e80b42860089.png)

### Mounting the Diffuser/Polarizer
* OpenScan Mini
* Polarizer Module

The Polarizer module can be easily mounted by clicking it onto the rotor:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57842400/174101063-19a57087-fed6-4942-9bfe-185390ca3e7c.png)

The polarizer module consists of two printed parts. It is very important that the smaller printed part (yellow circle) is not translucent in order to block all light.
There are two pieces of linear polarizer foil. The smaller piece (15x11mm) was inserted into the slot (red arrow). The larger piece (75x66mm) is covering the whole front area except for the middle (red arrow). It is absolutely crucial that those two pieces are oriented perpendicularly against each other. The polarizer will greatly improve the results by filtering almost all direct reflections.
