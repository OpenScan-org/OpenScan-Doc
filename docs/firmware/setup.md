# Firmware - Setup

## Overview

It is necessary to use a **Raspberry Pi with at least 1GB of RAM** to run the firmware. So far, the firmware has been tested on Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4B variants, but it might work on other versions.

The easiest way is to download the latest Raspbian image and flash your micro SD card as described [here](#flashing-the-sd-card-using-the-raspberry-pi-imager).

Alternatively you can set up the firmware manually by following [this guide](#manually-installing-and-setting-up-your-raspberry-pi).

## Flashing the SD Card using the Raspberry Pi Imager

I have pre-compiled a working Raspbian Image (2022-07-08), that can be downloaded from [Google Drive (1.5GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XXfUd6JgxX0Ry0_AVzdS8D8w36e8Bed7/view?usp=sharing) (working flawlessly on Raspberry Pi 3b+ and 4)

Download and flash the Raspbian Image to your Micro SD Card using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

## Manually installing and setting up your Raspberry Pi

The firmware and following installation guide is optimized for **Raspbian Bullseye with Desktop** environment, but can also be used headless (Note, that the desktop version comes with some libraries that you will otherwise need to install manually).

### Raspi-config

```sudo raspi-config```

```--> performance options --> GPU --> change to 256```
Increase GPU memory, which helps processing the captured photos

```--> localization settings --> wlan country --> your country```
Change the WLAN settings, so that device works in your area

Save and reboot now (or later ;)

### Folder structure

Create directories

``` mkdir /home/pi/OpenScan/ /home/pi/OpenScan/scans /home/pi/OpenScan/files /home/pi/OpenScan/settings /home/pi/OpenScan/tmp /home/pi/OpenScan/updates ```

### WLAN settings

Open the settings file

```sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces```

And add to the end:

```
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

### Samba (optional but highly recommended)

Create a shared network drive, so that you can easily access the Raspberry Pi's filesystem. It enables you to upload custom datasets to the OpenScanCloud through the browser interface. Simply copy a zip file containing your photos to the *../OpenScan/scans* directory.

Install the package

```sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin```

Open the configuration file

```sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf```

And change the following lines:

```
read only = no
create mask = 0775
directory mask = 0775
```

Add the following line, if you are using Windows:

```wins support = yes```

And add to the end of the file:

```
[PiShare]
comment=Raspberry Pi Share
path=/home/pi/
browseable=Yes
writeable=Yes
only guest=no
create mask=0777
directory mask=0777
public=yes
```

Set a password for user pi (by default I use password *raspberry*)

```sudo smbpasswd -a pi```

And add rights:

```sudo chmod -R 777 /home/pi/OpenScan```

### Gphoto

Necessary to controll DSLR cameras connected by USB cable.

```
sudo apt install libgphoto2-dev gphoto2
sudo pip3 install -v gphoto2
```

### NodeRed

Download and install:

```
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
```

--> confirm with yes and yes :)

Open node-red daemon file:

```sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/nodered.service```

add to the section [Unit]

```
Wants=network.target flask.service
After=flask.service
```

and change the following lines under [Service] to run nodered as root:

```
User = root
#Group = pi
```

Initialize node-red:

```sudo node-red admin init```

* settings file: ```/root/.node-red/settings.js```
* Security: ```No```
* Project: ```No```
* Flows File Settings: ```Enter```
* Passphrase: ```Enter```
* Theme: ```default```
* Text editor: ```default```
* External Modules: ```Yes```

Open node-red settings file:

```sudo nano /root/.node-red/settings.js```

And find, uncomment and change the following parameters:

```
userDir: '/home/pi/OpenScan/settings/.node-red/',

uiPort: process.env.PORT || 80,

httpAdminRoot: '/editor',

httpStatic: '/home/pi/OpenScan/',

ui: { path: "" },

functionGlobalContext: { // enables and pre-populates the context.global variable
    os:require('os'),
    path:require('path'),
    fs:require('fs')
    },
```

Enable nodered daemon and restart the device:

```
sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
sudo reboot -h
```

Open the node-red settings directory:

```cd /home/pi/OpenScan/settings/.node-red/```

And run the following command to install some additional palettes to node-red

```sudo npm i node-red-dashboard && sudo npm i node-red-contrib-python3-function && sudo npm i node-red-node-ui-table```

```node-red-restart```

### Libcamera - to run Arducam IMX519 (and other non-Raspberry-Pi camera moduls)

See [Arducam.com](https://www.arducam.com/docs/cameras-for-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-libcamera-guide/#how-to-install-libcamera-d9f38d46-8576-43e2-9375-e225c272095f) for more details

Download all necessary files

```wget -O install_pivariety_pkgs.sh https://github.com/ArduCAM/Arducam-Pivariety-V4L2-Driver/releases/download/install_script/install_pivariety_pkgs.sh && chmod +x install_pivariety_pkgs.sh```

### Download OpenScan Firmware

Custom node red flows (browser interface):

```sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan2/main/update/main/flows.json -O /home/pi/OpenScan/settings/.node-red/flows.json```

Some Python functions used by the firmware:

```sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan2/main/update/main/OpenScan.py -O /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/OpenScan.py```

A local server providing several functions (flask):

```sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan2/main/update/main/fla.py -O /home/pi/OpenScan/files/fla.py```

Custom config.txt file, which is needed to use different camera moduls (especially IMX519):

```sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan2/main/update/main/config.txt -O /boot/config.txt```

Arducam's camera focus script for the IMX519 sensor:

```sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan2/main/update/main/Arducam.py -O /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/Arducam.py```

And the OpenScan Logo to have a nice background:

```sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScan2/main/update/files/logo.jpg -O /home/pi/OpenScan/files/logo.jpg```

### Enable Flask local server:

create and open the service file:
```sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/flask.service```

with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=photo service
After=multi-user.target
[Service]
#ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 5
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/OpenScan/files/fla.py
StandardOutput=inherit
StandardError=inherit
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
User=root
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable flask.service && sudo systemctl start flask.service```

### others

add to /boot/config.txt to disable display which causes some issues --> WHY???

```hdmi_blanking=2```
